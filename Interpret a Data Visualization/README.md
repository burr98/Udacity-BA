# Project description
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, we’ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore. The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

For example one insight might look like:

“Deaths per year due to malaria in Senegal have been halved since 2007. From that dashboard, I clicked on Senegal on the map, this showed deaths due to malaria for each year from 2000 to 2014. Before 2007, there were about 1400-1500 deaths per year. After 2007, starting in 2008, deaths were reduced to about 600-700 per year.”
